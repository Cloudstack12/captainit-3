            <p>
                Spam is unsolicited messages or content that is sent to a large number of recipients, often for commercial purposes. It can take many forms, such as unwanted emails, comments, or links, and is usually sent in bulk by spammers looking to promote their products, services, or websites.
            </p>

            <p>
                Spam poses a significant problem for e-commerce websites and their customers. For e-commerce websites, spam can damage their reputation, reduce customer trust, and harm their search engine ranking. Spam attacks can also cause technical issues, such as server overload or crashes, resulting in website downtime and lost revenue.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                For customers, spam can have serious consequences. Spam messages can contain malware or phishing links that trick customers into revealing their personal information or installing malicious software. This can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other cybersecurity risks. Spam can also lead to fake reviews and ratings, making it difficult for customers to make informed purchase decisions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Spammers use various tactics to send spam messages, including phishing emails, social media spam, and fake product reviews. Phishing emails often look like legitimate emails from a trusted source, such as a bank or e-commerce website, but contain links to fraudulent websites that steal personal information. Social media spam can include fake accounts or unsolicited messages encouraging users to click links or buy products. Fake product reviews are a common spam tactic to promote products and manipulate customer opinion.
            </p>
